- 👋 Hi, I’m @N7FireAura
- 👀 I’m interested in Engine Plugin development for UnrealEngine, with an end-game of developing a UE-based game environment.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can brush up on (with a decade of accumulated rust, I need a good polish), as well as new techniques, tools, and concepts.  I'm happily swamped and eager to learn as much as I can.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything to learn, adapt, and flex.
- 📫 How to reach me ... (I'll leave this blank for now as I get acclimated)
